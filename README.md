# HW1-oa691

On this homework, I worked with William, Kelsey, Marc and Matt

We commnnicated through the email. I mentioned to the team the issue I had with the first part of the homework regarding merging. I was able to open text files but could not find the cursers that needed to be deleted and also differences of the history of the files on local compute and github. William mentioned make sure to set up the environment on github which I had done. I found out that the issue was to write a command to introduce emacs and notepad++ and clear all commits then begin again. This resolved the issue. I cleaned the cursers from the text and the compute was able to push to github and merge. I did not have input to the team.
